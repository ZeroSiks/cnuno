# HELLO GUYS


Create a Python program to manage a restaurant's orders, menu, and billing system. Each group will design, code, and document their solution, then submit a report detailing their approach, implementation, and testing.


# Instructions:

##    Problem Description:
    Build a simple text-based restaurant management system with the following features:
        Menu Management: Add, remove, or update items in the menu.
        Order Management: Take customer orders and calculate bills.
        Billing System: Generate and display the total bill for each table, including applicable taxes.

##    Requirements:
        Use Python data structures OR classes 
        Include basic input validation.
        Implement a menu-driven system for easy interaction.

##    Deliverables:
    Each group must submit the following:
        Python Code: Fully functional and well-documented.
        Project Report: A document (PDF or Word) containing:
            Introduction: Brief overview of the project.
            Design: Explanation of the program structure (include a flowchart or class diagram).
            Implementation: Describe key functions, algorithms, and any challenges faced.
            Testing: Include test cases with sample inputs/outputs.
            Conclusion: Summary of what was achieved and possible improvements.

##    Submission Guidelines:
        Submit the Python code as a .py file.
        Submit the project report as a PDF or Word document.
        Ensure all submissions are properly named (e.g., GroupName_ProjectName.pdf).

##    Evaluation Criteria:
        Functionality (50%): Does the program work as expected? Are all features implemented?
        Code Quality (20%): Is the code well-written, organized, and commented?
        Documentation (20%): Is the report clear, complete, and well-presented?
        Creativity (10%): Any extra features or enhancements.
